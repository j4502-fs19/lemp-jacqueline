    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <div class="container">
    <p>
      I enjoy sharing peopleâ€™s stories with the world, and I hope to one day continue doing this as a career.
      Reading and writing have always been passions of mine. Once I realized how I could put them to use through journalism, I knew what career path I wanted to pursue.
    Through the journalism school at the University of Missouri, I have not only learned what it takes to make a good story,
    but I have also been taught how to utilize multimedia elements to make them more captivating for audiences.
